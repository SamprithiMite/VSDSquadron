## 8 bit gray code counter

Gray code is a kind of binary number system where only one bit will change at a time. Today gray code is widely used in the digital world. 
It will be helpful for error correction and signal transmission. 
The Gray counter is also useful in design and verification in the VLSI domain.

## Applications of gray code counter

->The Gray code is used in the transmission of digital signals, as it minimizes the occurrence of errors.

->The Gray code is preferred over the straight binary code in angle-measuring devices.

 ->Use of the Gray code almost eliminates the possibility of an angle misread, which is likely if the angle is represented in straight binary.
 
 ->The cyclic property of the Gray code is a plus in this application.
 
->The Gray code is used for labelling the axes of Karnaugh maps, a graphical technique used for the minimization of Boolean expressions.

->The use of Gray codes to address program memory in computers minimizes power consumption. This is due to fewer address lines changing state with advances in the program counter.

->Gray codes are also very useful in genetic algorithms since mutations in the code allow for mostly incremental changes. However, occasionally a one-bit change can result in a big leap, thus leading to new properties.
